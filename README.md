The code is organized in several sub-directories, which contain the following content:

* **`demo`**
Code concerning the detection and analysis of alternative splicing events.

    * **`events`**
    Wrapper code for the detection.

* **`Candidate novel lncRNA identification`**
Contains code for candidate novel lncRNA identification.
