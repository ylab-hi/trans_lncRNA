# Code for *Trans-acting long non-coding RNA modulates long-range chromatin interactions associated with oncogenic MYC signaling*
Public repository containing research code for the trans-acting lncRNA project accompanying
the manuscript *The lncRNA landscape of advanced prostate cancer identified a role for IGF1R-AS1 in prostate cancer progression*

The code is organized into several sub-directories, which contain the following content:

* **`demo`**
Code concerning the detection and analysis of alternative splicing events.

    * **`events`**
    Wrapper code for the detection.

* **`Candidate novel lncRNA identification`**
Contains code for candidate novel lncRNA identification.
