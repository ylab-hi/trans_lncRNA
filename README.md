# Code for *Trans-acting long non-coding RNA modulates long-range chromatin interactions associated with oncogenic MYC signaling*

This repository contains the code used in the study "Trans-acting long non-coding RNA modulates long-range chromatin interactions associated with oncogenic MYC signaling."

The code is organized into the following sub-directories, each containing scripts for specific analyses performed during the research:

### 1. `lncRNA_candidate`
Contains scripts for the identification of candidate novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

### 2. `coding_potential`
Contains code for coding potential prediction of candidate lncRNAs.

### 3. `DEG_for_PRAD_N_T_SU2C`
Contains scripts for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PRAD normal, and SU2C datasets.

### 4. `igf1r_as1_network`
Contains code for constructing the promoter-enhancer interaction network.
